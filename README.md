# Hanasaku Discord Bot
Hanasaku Public Release Coded in Discord.js ! Basic commands in embed. Even Music!


# Installation
Linux is the only installation.
Available Version: CentOS 7 64 bit

On your Linux VPS do ```mkdir mybot && cd mybot``` after that you'll be in a folder called mybot.
After doing that install discord.js by typing ```npm install discord.js```
For sound support add ```npm install opusscript``` (ez mode) or ```npm install node-opus``` (better performance but requires ```python 2.7.x and build-essential)```. BOTH these options require ffmpeg to run on your system, installed through ```sudo apt-get install ffmpeg```

Once you've done that you can finally install discord.js music by typing ```npm install discord.js-music-v11```
Now you can clone the bot to your vps!
After that you're all set.
You can now run her by typing ```node mybot``` or ```node mybot.js``` . Thank you for installing Hanasaku!
